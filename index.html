      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>What differences are there in the language surrounding the word “gay” when it is used by a hateful online community like r/TheRedPill(as defined by Reddit, since they have quarantined the community) versus when it is used by supportive LGBTQ+ communities online like r/queer?
LLMs and AIs have built in “guardrails” developers use to censor “hateful language” in order to protect minority groups from harmful speech; however, this same process can also censor creators from these communities. For example, the word “queer” can be used as a slur against or as an identifier within LGBTQ+ communities (Stochastic Parrots). We will compare these communities’ language usages and structures(ex: Park et. al).  We also aim to examine some limitations of how automation might misclassify examples from r/queer based on language similarities between the communities. Such information could potentially be helpful for creating a more accurate model that of automated moderating that is less likely to censor queer creators and more likely to accurately identify community violations or other harmful speech.
